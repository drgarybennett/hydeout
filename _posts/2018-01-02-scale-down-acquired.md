Good science + good friends + wanting to do good + good-ish caffeine + good [hard] work + good luck = Scale Down.

I&#8217;m thrilled that our labor of love has been acquired by Anthem. I&#8217;ll have a lot more to say soon, but let&#8217;s go with this for now:

  1. Thanks, Kate. 
  2. Thanks, Dori. 
  3. Thanks, Leah. 
  4. Thanks, Users. 
  5. Thanks, Starbucks (they open early).
